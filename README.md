This responsive website shows all the relevant information a participant would like to know about the NGM PILOT conference scheduled for October 15th, 2022. I built it using **React** and **CSS**.

## The main feature of the website:

1. Countdown timer to October 15th, 2022.
2. Display of faqs using the disclosure tag â€“ details and summary
3. Slide with control buttons showing multiple speakers at once
